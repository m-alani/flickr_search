# Flickr Search  

A sample iPad app created to experiment with iOS internet connectivity APIs (to Flickr's APIs) & Grid Views.  
  
Note that the app is using Flickr's public API key (which is changed daily). If you would like to run it, you will need to replace the API key in "Config.swift" with your own key.
